Instead of writing separate HTML files and then trying to manipulate them with JavaScript, JSX lets you create your UI structure right inside your JavaScript code. Behind the scenes, React takes this JSX and transforms it into regular JavaScript instructions that the browser understands to create the actual HTML elements on the page.",

They can be as small as a button or as large as an entire webpage section.",
